# Host ASP.NET Core in a Windows Service

By [Luke Latham](https://github.com/guardrex) and [Tom Dykstra](https://github.com/tdykstra)

An ASP.NET Core app can be hosted on Windows without using IIS as a [Windows Service](/dotnet/framework/windows-services/introduction-to-windows-service-applications). When hosted as a Windows Service, the app automatically starts after reboots.

[View or download sample code](https://github.com/aspnet/Docs/tree/master/aspnetcore/host-and-deploy/windows-service/samples) ([how to download](xref:tutorials/index#how-to-download-a-sample))

## Convert a project into a Windows Service

The following minimum changes are required to set up an existing ASP.NET Core project to run as a service:

1. In the project file:

   * Confirm the presence of a Windows [Runtime Identifier (RID)](/dotnet/core/rid-catalog) or add it to the `<PropertyGroup>` that contains the target framework:

      ::: moniker range=">= aspnetcore-2.1"

      ```xml
      <PropertyGroup>
        <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>
        <RuntimeIdentifier>win7-x64</RuntimeIdentifier>
      </PropertyGroup>
      ```

      ::: moniker-end

      ::: moniker range="= aspnetcore-2.0"

      ```xml
      <PropertyGroup>
        <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.0</TargetFramework>
        <RuntimeIdentifier>win7-x64</RuntimeIdentifier>
      </PropertyGroup>
      ```

      ::: moniker-end

      ::: moniker range="< aspnetcore-2.0"

      ```xml
      <PropertyGroup>
        <TargetFramework>netcoreapp1.1</TargetFramework>
        <RuntimeIdentifier>win7-x64</RuntimeIdentifier>
      </PropertyGroup>
      ```

      ::: moniker-end

      To publish for multiple RIDs:

      * Provide the RIDs in a semicolon-delimited list.
      * Use the property name `<RuntimeIdentifiers>` (plural).

      For more information, see [.NET Core RID Catalog](/dotnet/core/rid-catalog).

   * Add a package reference for [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting.WindowsServices](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting.WindowsServices).

1. Make the following changes in `Program.Main`:

   * Call [host.RunAsService](/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.hosting.windowsservices.webhostwindowsserviceextensions.runasservice) instead of `host.Run`.

   * Call [UseContentRoot](xref:fundamentals/host/web-host#content-root) and use a path to the app's published location instead of `Directory.GetCurrentDirectory()`.

     ::: moniker range=">= aspnetcore-2.0"

     [!code-csharp[](windows-service/samples/2.x/AspNetCoreService/Program.cs?name=ServiceOnly&highlight=8-9,16)]

     ::: moniker-end

     ::: moniker range="< aspnetcore-2.0"

     [!code-csharp[](windows-service/samples_snapshot/1.x/AspNetCoreService/Program.cs?name=ServiceOnly&highlight=3-4,8,13)]

     ::: moniker-end

1. Publish the app. Use [dotnet publish](/dotnet/articles/core/tools/dotnet-publish) or a [Visual Studio publish profile](xref:host-and-deploy/visual-studio-publish-profiles). When using a Visual Studio, select the **FolderProfile**.

   To publish the sample app using command-line interface (CLI) tools, run the [dotnet publish](/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-publish) command at a command prompt from the project folder. The RID must be specified in the `<RuntimeIdenfifier>` (or `<RuntimeIdentifiers>`) property of the project file. In the following example, the app is published in Release configuration for the `win7-x64` runtime:

   ```console
   dotnet publish --configuration Release --runtime win7-x64
   ```

1. Use the [sc.exe](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/bb490995) command-line tool to create the service. The `binPath` value is the path to the app's executable, which includes the executable file name. **The space between the equal sign and the quote character at the start of the path is required.**

   ```console
   sc create <SERVICE_NAME> binPath= "<PATH_TO_SERVICE_EXECUTABLE>"
   ```

   For a service published in the project folder, use the path to the *publish* folder to create the service. In the following example:

   * The project resides in the *c:\\my_services\\AspNetCoreService* folder.
   * The project is published in `Release` configuration.
   * The Target Framework Moniker (TFM) is `netcoreapp2.1`.
   * The Runtime Identifer (RID) is `win7-x64`.
   * The app executable is named *AspNetCoreService.exe*.
   * The service is named **MyService**.

   Example:

   ```console
   sc create MyService binPath= "c:\my_services\AspNetCoreService\bin\Release\netcoreapp2.1\win7-x64\publish\AspNetCoreService.exe"
   ```

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > Make sure the space is present between the `binPath=` argument and its value.

   To publish and start the service from a different folder:

      * Use the [--output &lt;OUTPUT_DIRECTORY&gt;](/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-publish#options) option on the `dotnet publish` command. If using Visual Studio, configure the **Target Location** in the **FolderProfile** publish property page before selecting the **Publish** button.
      * Create the service with the `sc.exe` command using the output folder path. Include the name of the service's executable in the path provided to `binPath`.

1. Start the service with the `sc start <SERVICE_NAME>` command.

   To start the sample app service, use the following command:

   ```console
   sc start MyService
   ```

   The command takes a few seconds to start the service.

1. To check the status of the service, use the `sc query <SERVICE_NAME>` command. The status is reported as one of the following values:

   * `START_PENDING`
   * `RUNNING`
   * `STOP_PENDING`
   * `STOPPED`

   Use the following command to check the status of the sample app service:

   ```console
   sc query MyService
   ```

1. When the service is in the `RUNNING` state and if the service is a web app, browse the app at its path (by default, `http://localhost:5000`, which redirects to `https://localhost:5001` when using [HTTPS Redirection Middleware](xref:security/enforcing-ssl)).

   For the sample app service, browse the app at `http://localhost:5000`.

1. Stop the service with the `sc stop <SERVICE_NAME>` command.

   The following command stops the sample app service:

   ```console
   sc stop MyService
   ```

1. After a short delay to stop a service, uninstall the service with the `sc delete <SERVICE_NAME>` command.

   Check the status of the sample app service:

   ```console
   sc query MyService
   ```

   When the sample app service is in the `STOPPED` state, use the following command to uninstall the sample app service:

   ```console
   sc delete MyService
   ```

## Run the app outside of a service

It's easier to test and debug when running outside of a service, so it's customary to add code that calls `RunAsService` only under certain conditions. For example, the app can run as a console app with a `--console` command-line argument or if the debugger is attached:

::: moniker range=">= aspnetcore-2.0"

[!code-csharp[](windows-service/samples/2.x/AspNetCoreService/Program.cs?name=ServiceOrConsole)]

Because ASP.NET Core configuration requires name-value pairs for command-line arguments, the `--console` switch is removed before the arguments are passed to [CreateDefaultBuilder](/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.webhost.createdefaultbuilder).

> [!NOTE]
> `isService` isn't passed from `Main` into `CreateWebHostBuilder` because the signature of `CreateWebHostBuilder` must be `CreateWebHostBuilder(string[])` in order for [integration testing](xref:test/integration-tests) to work properly.

## Handle stopping and starting events

To handle [OnStarting](/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.hosting.windowsservices.webhostservice.onstarting), [OnStarted](/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.hosting.windowsservices.webhostservice.onstarted), and [OnStopping](/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.hosting.windowsservices.webhostservice.onstopping) events, make the following additional changes:

1. Create a class that derives from [WebHostService](/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.hosting.windowsservices.webhostservice):

   [!code-csharp[](windows-service/samples/2.x/AspNetCoreService/CustomWebHostService.cs?name=NoLogging)]

2. Create an extension method for [IWebHost](/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.hosting.iwebhost) that passes the custom `WebHostService` to [ServiceBase.Run](/dotnet/api/system.serviceprocess.servicebase.run):

   [!code-csharp[](windows-service/samples/2.x/AspNetCoreService/WebHostServiceExtensions.cs?name=ExtensionsClass)]

3. In `Program.Main`, call the new extension method, `RunAsCustomService`, instead of [RunAsService](/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.hosting.windowsservices.webhostwindowsserviceextensions.runasservice):

   ::: moniker range=">= aspnetcore-2.0"

   [!code-csharp[](windows-service/samples/2.x/AspNetCoreService/Program.cs?name=HandleStopStart&highlight=17)]

   > [!NOTE]
   > `isService` isn't passed from `Main` into `CreateWebHostBuilder` because the signature of `CreateWebHostBuilder` must be `CreateWebHostBuilder(string[])` in order for [integration testing](xref:test/integration-tests) to work properly.

   ::: moniker-end

   ::: moniker range="< aspnetcore-2.0"

   [!code-csharp[](windows-service/samples_snapshot/1.x/AspNetCoreService/Program.cs?name=HandleStopStart&highlight=27)]

   ::: moniker-end

If the custom `WebHostService` code requires a service from dependency injection (such as a logger), obtain it from the [IWebHost.Services](/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.hosting.iwebhost.services) property:

[!code-csharp[](windows-service/samples/2.x/AspNetCoreService/CustomWebHostService.cs?name=Logging&highlight=7-8)]

## Proxy server and load balancer scenarios

Services that interact with requests from the Internet or a corporate network and are behind a proxy or load balancer might require additional configuration. For more information, see <xref:host-and-deploy/proxy-load-balancer>.

## Configure HTTPS

Specify a [Kestrel server HTTPS endpoint configuration](xref:fundamentals/servers/kestrel#endpoint-configuration).

## Current directory and content root

The current working directory returned by calling `Directory.GetCurrentDirectory()` for a Windows Service is the *C:\\WINDOWS\\system32* folder. The *system32* folder isn't a suitable location to store a service's files (for example, settings files). Use one of the following approaches to maintain and access a service's assets and settings files with [FileConfigurationExtensions.SetBasePath](/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.configuration.fileconfigurationextensions.setbasepath) when using an [IConfigurationBuilder](/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.configuration.iconfigurationbuilder):

* Use the content root path. The `IHostingEnvironment.ContentRootPath` is the same path provided to the `binPath` argument when the service is created. Instead of using `Directory.GetCurrentDirectory()` to create paths to settings files, use the content root path and maintain the files in the app's content root.
* Store the files in a suitable location on disk. Specify an absolute path with `SetBasePath` to the folder containing the files.
