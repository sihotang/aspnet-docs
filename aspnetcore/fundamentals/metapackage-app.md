# Microsoft.AspNetCore.App metapackage for ASP.NET Core 2.1

This feature requires ASP.NET Core 2.1 and later targeting .NET Core 2.1 and later.

The [Microsoft.AspNetCore.App](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App) [metapackage](/dotnet/core/packages#metapackages) for ASP.NET Core:

* Does not include third-party dependencies except for [Json.NET](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Newtonsoft.Json/), [Remotion.Linq](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Remotion.Linq/), and [IX-Async](https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.Interactive.Async/). These 3rd-party dependencies are deemed necessary to ensure the major frameworks features function.
* Includes all supported packages by the ASP.NET Core team except those that contain third-party dependencies (other than those previously mentioned).
* Includes all supported packages by the Entity Framework Core team except those that contain third-party dependencies (other than those previously mentioned).

All the features of ASP.NET Core 2.1 and later and Entity Framework Core 2.1 and later are included in the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.App` package. The default project templates targeting ASP.NET Core 2.1 and later use this package. We recommend applications targeting ASP.NET Core 2.1 and later and Entity Framework Core 2.1 and later use the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.App` package.

The version number of the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.App` metapackage represents the ASP.NET Core version and Entity Framework Core version.

Using the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.App` metapackage provides version restrictions that protect your app:

* If a package is included that has a transitive (not direct) dependency on a package in `Microsoft.AspNetCore.App`, and those version numbers differ, NuGet will generate an error.
* Other packages added to your app cannot change the version of packages included in `Microsoft.AspNetCore.App`.
* Version consistency ensures a reliable experience. `Microsoft.AspNetCore.App` was designed to prevent untested version combinations of related bits being used together in the same app.

Applications that use the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.App` metapackage automatically take advantage of the ASP.NET Core shared framework. When you use the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.App` metapackage, **no** assets from the referenced ASP.NET Core NuGet packages are deployed with the application&mdash;the ASP.NET Core shared framework contains these assets. The assets in the shared framework are precompiled to improve application startup time. For more information, see "shared framework" in [.NET Core distribution packaging](/dotnet/core/build/distribution-packaging).

The following project file references the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.App` metapackage for ASP.NET Core and represents a typical ASP.NET Core 2.1 template:

```xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web">

  <PropertyGroup>
    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>
  </PropertyGroup>

  <ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.AspNetCore.App" Version="2.1.4" />
  </ItemGroup>

</Project>
```

The version number on the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.App` reference does **not** guarantee that version of the shared framework will be used. For example, suppose version `2.1.1` is specified, but `2.1.3` is installed. In that case, the app uses `2.1.3`. Although not recommended, you can disable roll-forward behavior (patch and/or minor). For more information on package version roll-forward behavior, see [dotnet host roll forward](https://github.com/dotnet/core-setup/blob/master/Documentation/design-docs/roll-forward-on-no-candidate-fx.md).

## Update ASP.NET Core

The `Microsoft.AspNetCore.App` [metapackage](/dotnet/core/packages#metapackages) isn't a traditional package that's updated from NuGet. Similar to `Microsoft.NETCore.App`, `Microsoft.AspNetCore.App` represents a shared runtime, which has special versioning semantics handled outside of NuGet. For more information, see [Packages, metapackages and frameworks](/dotnet/core/packages).

To update ASP.NET Core:

* On development machines and build servers: Download and install the [.NET Core SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download).
* On deployment servers: Download and install the [.NET Core runtime](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download).

 Applications will roll forward to the latest installed version on application restart. It's not necessary to update the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.App` version number in the project file. For more information, see [Framework-dependent apps roll forward](/dotnet/core/versions/selection#framework-dependent-apps-roll-forward).

If your application previously used `Microsoft.AspNetCore.All`, see [Migrating from Microsoft.AspNetCore.All to Microsoft.AspNetCore.App](xref:fundamentals/metapackage#migrate).
