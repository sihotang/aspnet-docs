# ASP.NET Core SignalR Java Client

By [Mikael Mengistu](https://twitter.com/MikaelM_12)

The Java client enables connecting to an ASP.NET Core SignalR server from Java code, including Android apps. Like the [JavaScript client](xref:signalr/javascript-client) and the [.NET client](xref:signalr/dotnet-client), the Java client enables you to receive and send messages to a hub in real time. The Java client is available in ASP.NET Core 2.2 and later.

The sample Java console app referenced in this article uses the SignalR Java client.

## Install the SignalR Java client package

The *signalr-0.1.0-preview2-35174* JAR file allows clients to connect to SignalR hubs. To find the latest JAR file version number, see the [Maven search results](https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:com.microsoft.aspnet%20AND%20a:signalr&core=gav).

If using Gradle, add the following line to the `dependencies` section of your *build.gradle* file:

```gradle
implementation 'com.microsoft.aspnet:signalr:0.1.0-preview2-35174'
```

If using Maven, add the following lines inside the `<dependencies>` element of your *pom.xml* file:

[!code-xml[pom.xml dependency element](java-client/sample/pom.xml?name=snippet_dependencyElement)]

## Connect to a hub

To establish a `HubConnection`, the `HubConnectionBuilder` should be used. The hub URL and log level can be configured while building a connection. Configure any required options by calling any of the `HubConnectionBuilder` methods before `build`. Start the connection with `start`.

[!code-java[Build hub connection](java-client/sample/src/main/java/Chat.java?range=17-20)]

## Call hub methods from client

A call to `send` invokes a hub method. Pass the hub method name and any arguments defined in the hub method to `send`.

[!code-java[send method](java-client/sample/src/main/java/Chat.java?range=31)]

## Call client methods from hub

Use `hubConnection.on` to define methods on the client that the hub can call. Define the methods after building but before starting the connection.

[!code-java[Define client methods](java-client/sample/src/main/java/Chat.java?range=22-24)]

## Known limitations

This is an early preview release of the Java client. There are many features that aren't supported yet. The following gaps are being worked on for future releases:

* Only primitive types can be accepted as parameters and return types.
* The APIs are synchronous.
* Only the "Send" call type is supported at this time. "Invoke" and streaming of return values aren't supported.
* Only the JSON protocol is supported.
* Only the WebSockets transport is supported.
