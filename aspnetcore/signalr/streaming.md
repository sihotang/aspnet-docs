# Use streaming in ASP.NET Core SignalR

By [Brennan Conroy](https://github.com/BrennanConroy)

ASP.NET Core SignalR supports streaming return values of server methods. This is useful for scenarios where fragments of data will come in over time. When a return value is streamed to the client, each fragment is sent to the client as soon as it becomes available, rather than waiting for all the data to become available.

## Set up the hub

A hub method automatically becomes a streaming hub method when it returns a `ChannelReader<T>` or a `Task<ChannelReader<T>>`. Below is a sample that shows the basics of streaming data to the client. Whenever an object is written to the `ChannelReader` that object is immediately sent to the client. At the end, the `ChannelReader` is completed to tell the client the stream is closed.

> [!NOTE]
> Write to the `ChannelReader` on a background thread and return the `ChannelReader` as soon as possible. Other hub invocations will be blocked until a `ChannelReader` is returned.

## .NET client

The `StreamAsChannelAsync` method on `HubConnection` is used to invoke a streaming method. Pass the hub method name, and arguments defined in the hub method to `StreamAsChannelAsync`. The generic parameter on `StreamAsChannelAsync<T>` specifies the type of objects returned by the streaming method. A `ChannelReader<T>` is returned from the stream invocation, and represents the stream on the client. To read data, a common pattern is to loop over `WaitToReadAsync` and call `TryRead` when data is available. The loop will end when the stream has been closed by the server, or the cancellation token passed to `StreamAsChannelAsync` is canceled.

```csharp
var channel = await hubConnection.StreamAsChannelAsync<int>("Counter", 10, 500, CancellationToken.None);

// Wait asynchronously for data to become available
while (await channel.WaitToReadAsync())
{
    // Read all currently available data synchronously, before waiting for more data
    while (channel.TryRead(out var count))
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"{count}");
    }
}

Console.WriteLine("Streaming completed");
```

## JavaScript client

JavaScript clients call streaming methods on hubs by using `connection.stream`. The `stream` method accepts two arguments:

* The name of the hub method. In the following example, the hub method name is `Counter`.
* Arguments defined in the hub method. In the following example, the arguments are: a count for the number of stream items to receive, and the delay between stream items.

`connection.stream` returns an `IStreamResult` which contains a `subscribe` method. Pass an `IStreamSubscriber` to `subscribe` and set the `next`, `error`, and `complete` callbacks to get notifications from the `stream` invocation.

[!code-javascript[Streaming javascript](streaming/sample/wwwroot/js/stream.js?range=19-36)]

To end the stream from the client, call the `dispose` method on the `ISubscription` that is returned from the `subscribe` method.
