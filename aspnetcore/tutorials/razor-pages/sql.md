# Work with SQL Server LocalDB and ASP.NET Core

By [Rick Anderson](https://twitter.com/RickAndMSFT) and [Joe Audette](https://twitter.com/joeaudette) 

The `MovieContext` object handles the task of connecting to the database and mapping `Movie` objects to database records. The database context is registered with the [Dependency Injection](xref:fundamentals/dependency-injection) container in the `ConfigureServices` method in the *Startup.cs* file:

::: moniker range="= aspnetcore-2.0"

[!code-csharp[](razor-pages-start/sample/RazorPagesMovie/Startup.cs?name=snippet_ConfigureServices&highlight=7-8)]

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range=">= aspnetcore-2.1"

[!code-csharp[](razor-pages-start/sample/RazorPagesMovie21/Startup.cs?name=snippet_ConfigureServices&highlight=12-13)]

For more information on the methods used in `ConfigureServices`, see:

* [EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) support in ASP.NET Core](xref:security/gdpr) for `CookiePolicyOptions`.
* [SetCompatibilityVersion](xref:mvc/compatibility-version)

::: moniker-end

The ASP.NET Core [Configuration](xref:fundamentals/configuration/index) system reads the `ConnectionString`. For local development, it gets the connection string from the *appsettings.json* file. The name value for the database (`Database={Database name}`) will be different for your generated code. The name value is arbitrary.

[!code-json[](razor-pages-start/sample/RazorPagesMovie/appsettings.json?highlight=2&range=8-10)]

When you deploy the app to a test or production server, you can use an environment variable or another approach to set the connection string to a real SQL Server. See [Configuration](xref:fundamentals/configuration/index) for more information.

## SQL Server Express LocalDB

LocalDB is a lightweight version of the SQL Server Express Database Engine that's targeted for program development. LocalDB starts on demand and runs in user mode, so there's no complex configuration. By default, LocalDB database creates "\*.mdf" files in the *C:/Users/\<user\>* directory.

<a name="ssox"></a>
* From the **View** menu, open **SQL Server Object Explorer** (SSOX).

  ![View menu](sql/_static/ssox.png)

* Right click on the `Movie` table and select **View Designer**:

  ![Contextual menu open on Movie table](sql/_static/design.png)

  ![Movie table open in Designer](sql/_static/dv.png)

Note the key icon next to `ID`. By default, EF creates a property named `ID` for the primary key.

* Right click on the `Movie` table and select **View Data**:

## Seed the database

Create a new class named `SeedData` in the *Models* folder. Replace the generated code with the following:

::: moniker range="= aspnetcore-2.0"

[!code-csharp[](razor-pages-start/sample/RazorPagesMovie/Models/SeedData.cs?name=snippet_1)]

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range=">= aspnetcore-2.1"

[!code-csharp[](razor-pages-start/sample/RazorPagesMovie21/Models/SeedData.cs?name=snippet_1)]

::: moniker-end

If there are any movies in the DB, the seed initializer returns and no movies are added.

```csharp
if (context.Movie.Any())
{
    return;   // DB has been seeded.
}
```
<a name="si"></a>
### Add the seed initializer

In *Program.cs*, modify the `Main` method to do the following:

* Get a DB context instance from the dependency injection container.
* Call the seed method, passing to it the context.
* Dispose the context when the seed method completes.

The following code shows the updated *Program.cs* file.

::: moniker range="= aspnetcore-2.0"

[!code-csharp[](razor-pages-start/sample/RazorPagesMovie/Program.cs)]

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range=">= aspnetcore-2.1"

[!code-csharp[](razor-pages-start/sample/RazorPagesMovie21/Program.cs)]

::: moniker-end

A production app would not call `Database.Migrate`. It's added to the preceding code to prevent the following exception when `Update-Database` has not been run:

SqlException: Cannot open database "RazorPagesMovieContext-21" requested by the login. The login failed.
Login failed for user 'user name'.

### Test the app

* Delete all the records in the DB. You can do this with the delete links in the browser or from [SSOX](xref:tutorials/razor-pages/new-field#ssox)
* Force the app to initialize (call the methods in the `Startup` class) so the seed method runs. To force initialization, IIS Express must be stopped and restarted. You can do this with any of the following approaches:

  * Right click the IIS Express system tray icon in the notification area and tap **Exit** or **Stop Site**:

    ![IIS Express system tray icon](../first-mvc-app/working-with-sql/_static/iisExIcon.png)

    ![Contextual menu](sql/_static/stopIIS.png)

    * If you were running VS in non-debug mode, press F5 to run in debug mode.
    * If you were running VS in debug mode, stop the debugger and press F5.
