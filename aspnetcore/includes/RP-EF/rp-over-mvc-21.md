The ASP.NET Core 2.1 Razor Pages version of this tutorial has many improvements over the 2.0 version.

The 2.0 tutorial teaches ASP.NET Core MVC and Entity Framework Core with controllers and views. Razor Pages is a page-based programming model that makes building web UI easier and more productive. We recommend the [Razor Pages](xref:data/ef-rp/intro) tutorial over the MVC version. The Razor Pages tutorial:

* Is easier to follow. For example, the scaffolding code has been significantly simplified.
* Provides more EF Core best practices.
* Uses more efficient queries.
* Is more current with the latest API.
* Covers more features.
* Is the preferred approach for new application development.

If you choose this tutorial over the [Razor Pages](xref:data/ef-rp/intro) version, let us know why in [this GitHub discussion](https://github.com/aspnet/Docs/issues/6146).
